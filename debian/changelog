ros-kinetic-rosflight-sim (1.0.0-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Update firmware to v1.1.0
  * improved acceleration calculation in simulation
  * some tweaks to make multi-agent possible
  * fixed some issues in SIL
  * working SIL multirotor
  * Cleaned up simulation launch and parameter files
  * updated board layer and python joy nodes
  * fixed a memory file write bug
  * able to arm, and disarm in simulation, IMU noise activated with motor spinning
  * fixed timestamping issue with simulator (need to test on hardware)
  * updated firmware
  * Got UDP comms working with SIL in Gazebo
  * launch files, xacro files, and aircraft parameters for generic multirotor and fixedwing aircraft are added.  They currently use a .dae that comes with gazebo, which might be confusing.  The best solution would be to create our own and include them here
  * added some noise with no bias
  * added sim, not tested, lacks udp and sensor noise
